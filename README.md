![Image of the font in use on the ECWC simultator](/documentation/image3.png)

These fonts mimic the fonts used in retro weather forecasts, intended for use with the [Retro Envrionment Canada Weather Channel simulator](https://github.com/Forceh91/retro-env-can-weather-chan).

## About

[David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com) draws letters of all shapes and sizes for custom and retail typeface designs. He is based in Western Massachusetts.


## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://djrrb.github.io/retro-env-can-weather-chan-fonts.git.
